## What is HandyTran ?
HandyTran is a simple translator which speeds up translating words/sentences (ENG -> PL) in daily activities. During reading articles, browsing pages you can wonder about meaning of word(s). Here comes HandyTran :slightly_smiling_face:

## How to launch and how does it work ?
Download my script (ahk) and project. Edit script to modify the path of project where it is. You can also custom Hot Key. It is your decision. Alt+x is by default. Apart mentioned items, check your python version. It should be at least 3.x. I encourage you to add this script to folder **Startup** which runs it during launching the OS. It provides readiness to work in any time
In system searcher type **run**. Then **shell:startup** and drag and drop your *.ahk* script into this folder.
# 
Just select word (or short text), press ctrl+c and then alt+x. Script translates only the newest clipboard content and displays translated version as notification.
